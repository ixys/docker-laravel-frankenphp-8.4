# Public Directory

This directory contains minimal Laravel public files for Docker build testing.

In a real Laravel project, this directory would contain:
- index.php (Laravel entry point)
- Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
- Built frontend assets (from Vite/Mix)

The files here are minimal examples to allow the Docker build to complete successfully.
